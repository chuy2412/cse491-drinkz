Story1: Joe has a small budget but a big thirst for
        drinks, so he wants to be able to see 
        different liquor types and their cost to
        determine what drink to buy.
       
Story2: Joe is interested only on a few liquor types
	so he is too lazy to see the entire database
        of drinks and their cost, so he wants to be 
	able to search the database of liquor prices
	by liquor types.

A. Data Component: A database of liquor prices
		   Source: Virginia Department of
                           Alcoholic Beverage Control
                   Stored in: drinkz/drinks_cost.csv

B.  API for storing/retrieving/querying the relevant data
    Created a new class in: drinkz/cost.py
    Class contains functions to load database, return results
    and search cost by liquor type

C.  A Web interface for display and modifying the relevant data
    Created functions in drinkz/app.py and drinkz/dynamic_web.py

D. A set of JSON-RPC functions
   Added function in drinkz/app.py
