This document describes how to use bulk-load recipes


Usage:   python bin/load-recipes [filename]

Where [filename] represents the name of the file.

Comments: the file should contain the following information
	  For every line: [name],[ingredients]
	  where [name] is the name of the recipe
	  and [ingredients] has the following format: ingredient_name,ingredient_amount
	  Note: a recipe can contain multiple ingredients (as long as they are separated
		by a comma).
          For example:    vodka martini,unflavored vodka,6 oz,vermouth,1.5 oz
			  in this case [name] = vodka martini
			               [ingredients] = unflavored vodka,6 oz,vermouth,1.5 oz


Some sample files were added in test-data/ to test usage
	recipe-data1.txt   (Example with 1 recipe and 1 ingredient)
	recipe-data2.txt   (Example with 2 recipes and multiple ingredients)
	recipe-data3.txt   (Example with 3 recipes and multiple ingredients)

Test cases were added in drinkz/test_drinkz.py
	In particular: test_bulk_load_recipes_1()
		       test_bulk_load_recipes_2()
		       test_bulk_load_recipes_3()
