6.1  Implemented a WSGI server that speaks POST
      Reference from 
      https://github.com/ctb/cse491-drinkz/blob/hw5-solutions/server.py

      Added server.py on the main directory
      How to run:
	"python server.py"
	Then it will display the server and post number
	Use your favorite browser and connect to the server and include the 
	 port number

6.2  Feature implementation was added since homework 5
     I thought implementation was requiered on hw5 so I added that on my solution
	A documentation can be found in: "FEATURE.txt"

     The 2 features can be found under the "Conversion" section
     Brief description:
	"View drink prices" Allows the user to see the entire database
			    of drinks with their respective price

	"Search price of drink type" Allows the user to search the price
				     of all drinks of the given type
  	

6.3 Change db.py to use SQLite - Not implemented
    Unable to implement this functionality

6.4
